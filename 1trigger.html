          <p class="description">
            <br />“Stress doesn't always knock. Sometimes, it breaks in
            silently.” <br />These are the zones that activate my stress —
            Sometimes one by one, sometimes all at once.
            <br />________________________________________ <br /><b
              >🔻 Assignment Overload</b
            >
            <br />Multiple assignments. Multiple deadlines. The pressure stacks
            up in my mind like a tower ready to fall. Even small tasks feel too
            big. I open the file… then just stare.
            <br />________________________________________ <br /><b
              >🔻 Multi-Tasking Madness</b
            >
            <br />College club duties. Job work. Personal goals. Family.
            Friends. All at once. My mind gets jammed trying to switch between
            everything. No pause. No peace.
            <br />________________________________________ <br /><b
              >🔻 The Comparison Trigger</b
            >
            <br />I see people like: • D. Gukesh – Youngest Indian chess champ •
            Tilak Mehta – Built a ₹100 crore startup at 13 • Vaibhav Suryavanshi
            – Youngest to hit a century in IPL And then I ask myself: "What am I
            doing?" "Why am I not even close?"
            ________________________________________ <br /><b
              >🔻 Social Silence</b
            >
            <br />In groups, meetings, or presentations— I know I should speak.
            I even rehearse the words in my head. But when the moment comes, my
            voice disappears. If I don't speak, stress attacks me later like a
            shadow. If I do, I survive the moment. But the fear returns again
            and again. <br />________________________________________ <br /><b
              >🔻 The Idle Trap</b
            >
            <br />I don't usually play games. But once, I played PUBG for a full
            week—non-stop. Screen time reached 12–14 hours/day. It felt fun…
            until reality hit me. "What am I doing with my time?" I instantly
            uninstalled it. And I never looked back. Even now, if I ever slip, I
            uninstall immediately. No excuses.
            <br />________________________________________ <br /><b
              >🔻 Unplanned Days</b
            >
            <br />Days with no plan feel harmless. But they become the most
            dangerous. I waste hours doing nothing meaningful. And at night,
            guilt takes over. "You wasted another day…"
            <br />________________________________________ <br /><b
              >These are my trigger zones—each one pulling me deeper into
              stress, in a different way. Now you know what they look like.</b
